\begin{description}
    \item[a)] \verb/p(a b c d f)/ = \n
        $p(a)*p(b)*p(c)*p(d)*p(f) =$ \n
        $8/46*6/46*8/46*8/46*9/46 = 0.000134$\n\n
        Therefore, the probability of the first sentence is \textbf{0.000134}.
    \item[b)] \verb/p(a b b c c d)/ = \n
        $p(a)*p(b)*p(b)*p(c)*p(c)*p(d) =$ \n
        $8/46*6/46*6/46*8/46*8/46*8/46 = 0.000015$\n\n
        Therefore, the probability of the second sentence is \textbf{0.000015}.
